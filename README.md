# 🥫 Food Saver

Welcome to **Food Saver**! 🍕🍰🥬 This iOS app for keeping track of food items in your household, helping you avoid waste and stay organized.

Food Saver is more than an app—it’s my learning experiment in embracing Swift and Apple frameworks using an LLM-oriented workflow. I began by crafting a [*product specification document*](./product_specifications.md), which outlines the high-level steps to build **Food Saver**. With this blueprint, I worked with ChatGPT-4o to code the app in Xcode.

The product specification is a living document designed to maintain the app’s core features, design, and structure. It’s written in plain text to ensure compatibility with current and future LLMs, making the app as rewritable and future-proof as possible. The goal is to reduce legacy tech debt, enabling Food Saver to adapt to new platforms and technologies with minimal overhead. As **Food Saver** grows in complexity, I'm interested in finding out whether providing an LLM the "why" behind code improves its reliability in software development.
